My academic journey began with a degree in Telecommunications and Computer Science at the Multinational School of Telecommunications in Dakar. This initial step provided me with a solid foundation in technical areas that shaped my professional future. Eager to further explore the world of technology, I pursued certification as a web and mobile project manager at EPITECH Paris. This experience allowed me to refine my skills in digital project management, preparing me for more complex challenges.

My path was further enriched with a Master's in Dev Manager Full Stack at EFREI, where I delved deeper into the development of web and mobile applications. This stage provided me with thorough expertise and a holistic understanding of the digital creation process.

I had the opportunity to put my skills into practice during two years of alternating at Luxe For Guide as a Full Stack developer. It was a period of intense professional growth, during which I contributed to significant projects and developed team management skills. In recognition of my efforts and contribution, I was promoted to the position of Project Manager within the same company.

My commitment to continuous learning and practical implementation of knowledge continues to motivate me. My goal is to push the boundaries of technological innovation while sharing my skills with future generations.

I look forward to meeting you to discuss further about my journey and potential opportunities for collaboration.
